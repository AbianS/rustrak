 * that only stays true if the count fits both layouts without an orphan. It is
 * the same arithmetic the SDK strip and the footprint numbers depend on, and it
 * is the reason the outbound links are a fourth group rather than a stray pair
 * dropped under the third.

/**
 * The footer, uncovered by the page sliding over it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no giant wordmark. One was tried — `RUSTRAK` at 320px,
 * bled to the frame's rules — and it is four and a half times the largest type
 * anywhere else here, so it reads as a different page's masthead arriving just
 * as this one is meant to hand over quietly. It also cost 230px of height, most
 * of what a footer should measure in total. See the display scale note in
 * `globals.css`. The mark is the nav's, at the nav's size.
 *
 * No rule along the top, and that is not an omission: the closing band already
 * closes against its own bottom hairline, so a second here would double it
 * where the two meet. During the reveal that hairline is the moving edge, and
 * this footer has no edge of its own until it is uncovered.
 *
 * The reveal is the lid idea again, by a different mechanism, and the
 * difference is why this is not a `Pinned`. `Pinned` sticks to the *top* of the
 * viewport, which forces its band to be a full screen tall — right for one
 * sentence over a fresco, wrong for a footer. Sticking to the *bottom* removes
 * the constraint: the footer is whatever height its contents make it, and the
 * closing band above covers it until it does not (see `Cover` in
 * `landing-page.tsx`). The arithmetic falls out — scroll up by δ and exactly δ
 * less of the footer shows — so there is no corridor to pad and no two numbers
 * to keep in agreement.
 *
 * It cannot get this wrong, either: a sticky element is clamped by its
 * containing block, which here is the box holding the closing band *and* this
 * footer, so the footer physically cannot be pulled above the closing's top
 * edge. A window too short simply ends the reveal early.
 *
 * Below `sm` this is an ordinary block at the end of the document. Uncovering a
 * footer is something you notice steering a wheel; with a thumb it reads as a
 * footer that lags.
