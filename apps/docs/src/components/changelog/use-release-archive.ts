/**
 * The archive: which releases are on the page, and how to go and get the rest.
 *
 * It exists for one reason. The page ships the ten most recent releases and
 * nothing else, because rendering every release on one URL was 604KB of HTML
 * growing by a release a fortnight. Older ones are fetched a chunk at a time
 * from static JSON generated at build time (`changelog/releases/[chunk]`),
 * which keeps the first response the same size in two years as it is today.
 *
 * So the reveal is a real fetch, not a stack of hidden markup with a button
 * over it. That distinction is the entire exercise: hiding it in CSS would
 * have left all 604KB in the document and only moved the scrollbar.
 *
 * Split out of `changelog-feed.tsx` when the spectrum landed: two consumers
 * need to jump to a release that may not be loaded (a deep link and a click on
 * the spectrum), and the component that renders the feed should not also be the
 * place that owns a fetch loop and two effects' worth of scroll restoration.
