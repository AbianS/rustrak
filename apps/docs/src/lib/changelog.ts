/**
 * The changelog, read off `content/changelog/*.mdx` and turned into data.
 *
 * Server-only: it opens the filesystem. Anything the browser also needs lives
 * in `./release`.
 *
 * ── Why this stopped going through Nextra ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The page used to render each release with `importPage()`, which compiles the
 * file as an MDX *page* and hands back a React component. That works, and it
 * has one property this page cannot live with: a component can only be
 * rendered by the server that imported it, so every release had to be in the
 * first response. Forty-one of them came to 604KB of HTML and a 296KB RSC
 * payload for a single URL, growing by roughly 20KB per release.
 *
 * Rendering to an HTML string instead makes a release *transferable*: the same
 * shape can be inlined into the page or fetched later from a static file (see
 * `app/(docs)/changelog/releases/[chunk]/route.ts`). The content affords it —
 * every entry is plain Markdown, with no JSX, no imports and no code fences —
 * so nothing is lost by leaving the MDX pipeline out of it.
