# FAQ

## General

### What SDKs work with Rustrak?

Any Sentry SDK. Rustrak implements the Sentry protocol, so you can use the official Sentry SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, and more.

### Is Rustrak a Sentry replacement?

Rustrak focuses on **error tracking only**. It doesn't support:
- Performance monitoring
- Session tracking
- Release management
- Replays

If you need these features, use the hosted Sentry service.

### How much resources does Rustrak need?

| Setup | RAM | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Server only | ~50MB | Dashboard runs elsewhere |
| Full stack | ~200MB | Server + Dashboard |

For a 512MB VPS, server-only is recommended.

### Can I migrate from Sentry?

Yes, just change your DSN. Your SDK code stays the same:

```javascript
// Before
Sentry.init({ dsn: 'https://key@sentry.io/123' });

// After
Sentry.init({ dsn: 'http://key@your-server:8080/1' });
```

Historical data doesn't migrate—you start fresh.

## Deployment

### Do I need to run the dashboard?

No. You can run only the server and access the dashboard:
- Locally on your laptop
- Deployed on Vercel (free)
- Not at all (API-only usage)

This keeps your server footprint minimal.

### Can I run Rustrak without Docker?

Yes. Build from source:

```bash
cd apps/server
cargo build --release
./target/release/rustrak
```

You'll need PostgreSQL running separately.

### How do I backup my data?

Backup PostgreSQL:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U rustrak rustrak > backup.sql
```

Restore:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U rustrak rustrak < backup.sql
```

## Data

### How long are events stored?

Indefinitely, unless you delete them. There's no automatic retention policy (yet).

### Can I export my data?

Yes, via the API:

```bash
# Get all issues
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/issues

# Get events for an issue
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/issues/1/events
```

### Is my data encrypted?

- **In transit**: Use HTTPS (configure via reverse proxy)
- **At rest**: Depends on your PostgreSQL setup

Rustrak doesn't add additional encryption.

## Troubleshooting

### Why are my errors grouped incorrectly?

Rustrak groups by exception type, message, and transaction. Use custom fingerprints for better control:

```javascript
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  fingerprint: ['my-custom-group'],
});
```

### Why don't I see stack traces?

Check that your SDK is configured to send them. For minified JavaScript, you'll need source maps (not yet supported by Rustrak).

### Can I ignore certain errors?

Use your SDK's `beforeSend` hook:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN',
  beforeSend(event) {
    if (event.message?.includes('Expected error')) {
      return null; // Don't send
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```

Or mute issues in the dashboard.

## Features

### Does Rustrak support alerts?

Not yet. This is planned for a future release.

### Can I integrate with Slack/PagerDuty?

Not built-in. You can use the API to build custom integrations.

### Is there multi-user support?

Yes. Create users and they can all access the dashboard. There's no role-based access control yet—all users have full access.

### Is there multi-organization support?

No. Rustrak is designed for single-team use. For multiple organizations, run separate instances.
