# Overview

Rustrak is a lightweight, self-hosted error tracking system. It's compatible with Sentry SDKs, so you can use your existing setup—just change the DSN.

## Why Rustrak?

- **Self-hosted**: Your data stays on your servers
- **Lightweight**: ~50MB RAM, ~20MB Docker image
- **Fast**: Under 50ms ingestion latency
- **Simple**: No complex configuration required
- **Free**: No per-event pricing, no limits

## How it works

```
Your App → Sentry SDK → Rustrak Server → PostgreSQL
                              ↓
                        Dashboard (optional)
```

Your application sends errors using any Sentry SDK. Rustrak receives them, groups similar errors into issues, and stores everything in PostgreSQL. You view and manage issues through the dashboard.

## Deployment options

Rustrak has a unique architecture that separates the server from the dashboard:

| Option | Server | Dashboard | Best for |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Full stack** | Your server | Your server | Small teams, development |
| **Server only** | Your server | Your laptop | Minimal server resources |
| **Server only** | Your server | Vercel (free) | Production with zero server overhead |

### Server-only deployment

The Rustrak server uses only **~50MB RAM**. If you run the dashboard locally or on Vercel, your server only needs to handle API requests—no frontend assets, no Node.js runtime.

```bash
# On your server: just the Rust binary
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/rustrak \
  -e SESSION_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e CREATE_SUPERUSER=admin@example.com:your-secure-password \
  abians7/rustrak-server:latest

# Dashboard on another machine or Vercel
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e RUSTRAK_API_URL=https://your-server.com \
  abians7/rustrak-ui:latest
```

This is perfect for:
- VPS with limited RAM (512MB-1GB)
- Edge deployments
- Cost-conscious setups
