# Quickstart

Let's capture your first error. This takes about 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Rustrak installed and running ([Installation guide](/getting-started/installation))
- Admin user created
- An application to track errors (we'll use a simple example)

## Step 1: Log in

Open your Rustrak dashboard and log in with your admin credentials.

## Step 2: Create a project

1. Click **New Project**
2. Enter a name (e.g., "my-app")
3. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Copy your DSN

After creating the project, you'll see a DSN (Data Source Name). It looks like this:

```
http://a1b2c3d4e5f6@localhost:8080/1
```

Copy it—you'll need it in the next step.

## Step 4: Install a Sentry SDK

Rustrak works with any Sentry SDK. Pick your language:

```bash
# JavaScript / Node.js
npm install @sentry/browser
# or
npm install @sentry/node

# Python
pip install sentry-sdk

# Go
go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go

# Rust
cargo add sentry
```

## Step 5: Initialize the SDK

Add this to your application's entry point:

```javascript
// JavaScript (browser or Node.js)
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser'; // or '@sentry/node'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE', // paste your DSN
});
```

```python
# Python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="YOUR_DSN_HERE")
```

```go
// Go
import "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"

sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn: "YOUR_DSN_HERE",
})
```

```rust
// Rust
let _guard = sentry::init("YOUR_DSN_HERE");
```

## Step 6: Trigger a test error

Send a test message to verify everything works:

```javascript
// JavaScript
Sentry.captureMessage("Hello from Rustrak!");
```

```python
# Python
sentry_sdk.capture_message("Hello from Rustrak!")
```

```go
// Go
sentry.CaptureMessage("Hello from Rustrak!")
```

```rust
// Rust
sentry::capture_message("Hello from Rustrak!", sentry::Level::Info);
```

## Step 7: Check the dashboard

Go back to your Rustrak dashboard. You should see your first issue:

1. Click on your project
2. You'll see an issue titled "Hello from Rustrak!"
3. Click on it to see the full details

**Congratulations!** You've successfully set up error tracking.

## Step 8: Capture a real error

Now try capturing an actual exception:

```javascript
// JavaScript
try {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```

```python
# Python
try:
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
except Exception as e:
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
```

Check the dashboard again—you'll see a new issue with a full stack trace.

## Step 9: Add context

Make debugging easier by adding user and custom context:

```javascript
// Set user info
Sentry.setUser({
  id: "123",
  email: "user@example.com",
});

// Add custom tags
Sentry.setTag("feature", "checkout");

// Add breadcrumbs
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  category: "user",
  message: "User clicked checkout",
  level: "info",
});
```

## Step 10: Resolve the test issue

1. Go to your test issue in the dashboard
2. Click **Resolve**
3. The issue moves to the resolved state

If the same error happens again, Rustrak will reopen it automatically.
