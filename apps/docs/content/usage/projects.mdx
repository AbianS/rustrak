# Projects

Projects are how you organize your applications in Rustrak. Each project has its own DSN, issues, and events.

## Creating a project

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "my-app")
4. Click **Create**

Your project gets:
- A unique **DSN** for SDK configuration
- A **slug** based on the name (e.g., "my-app")
- An auto-assigned **ID**

## The DSN

The DSN (Data Source Name) is what you give to Sentry SDKs:

```
http://<sentry_key>@<host>:<port>/<project_id>
```

Example:
```
http://a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890@localhost:8080/1
```

Copy it from project settings and use it in your app:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
});
```

## Project slug

The slug appears in issue IDs:

- Project "My App" → slug `my-app`
- Issue short ID: `MY-APP-1`, `MY-APP-42`

## Deleting a project

**Warning**: This permanently deletes all issues and events.

1. Open project settings
2. Click **Delete Project**
3. Confirm

## Best practices

### Naming

Use clear names:
- `frontend-web`
- `api-server`
- `mobile-ios`

### Environment separation

**Option 1: Separate projects** (for large teams)
- `myapp-production`
- `myapp-staging`

**Option 2: Tags** (simpler)
```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN',
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
});
```

Filter by environment in the dashboard.

### When to create separate projects

Create separate projects when:
- Different applications (web, mobile, API)
- Different teams own different codebases
- Compliance requires data separation

Use one project when:
- Same codebase, different environments
- Small team managing everything
