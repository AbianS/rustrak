## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bd78a7e`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/bd78a7e8608ef6071480ab8563eef932320601de) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Transaction ingestion pipeline with processor-pattern architecture, transaction detail endpoint, new performance dashboard UI with sidebar redesign, and client/MCP API wiring to support the new transaction endpoints

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [`a2b791b`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/a2b791b54e0db5630741c268dc1d14ec93b968cd) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Release health period selector: the period parameter is now optional and configurable from the UI via a dropdown (24h, 48h, 7d). Previously the stats endpoint defaulted to 24h with no override. Also updates 35 JS and 11 Rust dependencies, removes 8 unused webview-ui packages, and fixes the Docker Rust base image version.

Performance monitoring transactions are now correctly skipped during error ingestion, matching Sentry Relay's ErrorsProcessor behavior.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`5a0854b`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/5a0854bfd62e1e7e7267b89de248bfab40707b4c) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - chore: migrate repository to rustrak GitHub organization and Docker Hub

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`fd768de`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/fd768de0816ba6eeeaa26ed8893d82bd6224fd2b) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Add source map upload and stack frame rewriting support.

  ## @rustrak/server

  - **Source map processing pipeline** — New `POST /api/projects/{id}/files/` endpoint accepts artifact bundles (gzip/zip) and individual `.map` files via multipart upload, stores chunks, and assembles them asynchronously (workers/sourcemap_assembly.rs)
  - **Frame rewriting** — Digest worker now resolves minified stack frames to original source positions using stored source maps; file/line/col/context_line are rewritten in-place before event storage
  - **Assembly state machine** — chunk upload → assembly job → frame rewriting with retry logic; `retry_count` resets on re-queue; HTTP 200 with `missingChunks` field returned for assembly error state (Sentry protocol compliant)
  - **Migrations** — two new migrations: remove issue soft delete (`20260521`), source maps tables (`20260522`)
  - **Hard delete for issues** — `deleted_at` soft delete replaced with immediate CASCADE hard delete; reduces storage and simplifies queries

  ## @rustrak/client

  - **`SourceMapsResource`** — New resource class implementing the Sentry artifact bundle upload protocol: `createArtifactBundle()`, `uploadChunk()`, `assembleArtifacts()` with chunk-hash-keyed multipart fields
  - Exported from package root alongside existing resources

  ## webview-ui

  - Fix breadcrumb rendering — level badge and message display corrected after PR [#89](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/issues/89) review
  - Fix event display — improved titles, tags layout, and breadcrumb columns in event detail view

  ## docs

  - New `/usage/source-maps` page with upload guide and environment setup
  - Blog post: "Source Maps in Rust" covering the implementation approach
  - Updated environment reference with source map related config

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [`324cefd`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/324cefdfbd305d1e53e79ac10c55ca52cc8ef8a4) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Fix PUBLIC_URL env var for DSN generation, replace issue soft delete with hard delete, and bump astral-tokio-tar to address RUSTSEC-2026-0145.

  - `@rustrak/server`: Add `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable support so the DSN returned by the server uses the correct public-facing host instead of the internal bind address
  - `@rustrak/server`: Replace issue soft delete with hard delete — issues and their child events/groupings are now removed permanently via CASCADE on DELETE
  - `@rustrak/server`: Bump `astral-tokio-tar` to 0.6.2 to resolve security advisory RUSTSEC-2026-0145
  - `docs`: Document `PUBLIC_URL` in environment reference, quickstart, production guide, and troubleshooting pages

- [`40ba761`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/40ba76136d2c455fc22fcc1b99850eb3d29769bd) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - **server**: migrate all alert-channel and alert-rule endpoints from `AuthenticatedUser` to `ApiAuth` extractor, enabling bearer token access to the alerts API

  **client**: remove `private` flag and add `publishConfig` for npm publishing; bump zod to 4.4.3, msw to 2.14.6, vitest to 4.1.6, @types/node to 25.8.0

  **mcp**: wire npm publish in CI pipeline for initial public release of `@rustrak/mcp`

## 0.2.3

  - fix(digest): delete orphaned temp files on processing error
  - fix(projects): retry slug INSERT on unique collision instead of 409

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [`3fc4abb`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/3fc4abba96170c7fbbac708aeb0296c7e759818c) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - ## webview-ui

  ### Features

  - **Skeleton loading states** — issue and event detail routes now show skeleton UI while fetching, eliminating layout shift on navigation
  - **Full mobile responsiveness** — projects page, project detail, settings section, event detail, and global header all adapted for small screens
  - **Base UI migration** — replaced all Radix UI primitives (shadcn/ui) with Base UI equivalents; corrected data attribute selectors and dropdown widths; rewired form a11y and tabs keyboard orientation
  - **Brand icon** — replaced generic Terminal icon with the Rustrak bolt SVG logo icon across the UI

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed stale state on issue dropdown actions by passing `id` directly instead of through closure capture
  - Fixed sticky event sidebar not respecting viewport height
  - Fixed API docs link in tokens settings page
  - Restored correct keyboard orientation for tab components after Base UI migration

  ## @rustrak/server

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/pull/44) [`4a84415`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/4a84415d867b5a1f15f11006278527671d62b242) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Upgrade all dependencies to latest versions across the monorepo.

  - TypeScript 6.0.3 + Node.js engines >=22 across all packages
  - ky 2.x migration: `prefix` (was `prefixUrl`), updated hook signatures, removed 429 from retry list to avoid `Retry-After` sleep
  - lucide-react 1.x: replaced removed `Github` brand icon with inline SVG component
  - Rust: actix-web 4.13, actix-session 0.11, tokio 1.52, sqlx 0.8.6, rand 0.10 (`RngExt`), sha2 0.11 (`hex::encode`), hmac 0.13 (`KeyInit`)

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#39](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/pull/39) [`447596b`](https://github.com/rustrak/rustrak/commit/447596b77655e6c8bc24257c603d1a992fb4cb03) Thanks [@kervel](https://github.com/kervel)! - SQLite is now the default database backend

  BREAKING CHANGE: The `latest` Docker image now uses SQLite instead of PostgreSQL.

  If you are using `rustrak/rustrak-server:latest` with PostgreSQL, update your image tag:

  ```yaml
  # Before
  image: rustrak/rustrak-server:latest

  # After
  image: rustrak/rustrak-server:postgres
  ```

  No data migration required — only the image tag changes.

  New: SQLite support with zero configuration. No `DATABASE_URL` needed — data is stored automatically at `/data/rustrak.db` inside the container. Mount a volume at `/data` to persist data.

  Docker Hub now publishes two variants per release:

  - `latest` / `vX.Y.Z` → SQLite (default, no external database)
  - `postgres` / `vX.Y.Z-postgres` → PostgreSQL

  New "Database Backends" documentation page with SQLite vs PostgreSQL comparison, Docker Compose examples, and backup strategies.
