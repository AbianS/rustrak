/**
 * How modals open.
 *
 * In a dashboard a modal is almost never "a part of the screen that
 * sometimes shows": it is a question asked in the middle of a function --
 * pick a project, confirm this -- whose answer is needed on the next line.
 * Written as screen state, that function splits into three pieces and the
 * modal rides the tree of a screen that is not about it.
 *
 * So they open by being called, and they are awaited:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const project = await pickProject.open({ team });
 * if (!project) return;                // closed without choosing
 * assign(issue, project);
 * ```
 *
 * What renders does **not** leave the React tree: a `DialogProvider` sits at
 * the root and is what mounts the modal, so the theme, the data client and
 * everything else that travels by context still hold inside. The registry
 * lives in a module rather than a context so `open()` can also be called
 * from where there is no component: a table handler, a domain function, a
 * request interceptor.
