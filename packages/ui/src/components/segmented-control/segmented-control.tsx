/**
 * A short, closed set of mutually exclusive choices, all visible at once: the
 * time range (1 h · 24 h · 7 d · 14 d · 30 d · All), sort direction, a chart's
 * unit.
 *
 * It is not a dropdown and it is not tabs. A dropdown would hide five options
 * to save the width of four words, and this control is used constantly; tabs
 * change what the page is about, whereas this changes a parameter of what is
 * already on it.
 *
 * Beyond about six options this is the wrong control -- the row starts
 * competing with the page title for width. That is where a menu belongs.
 *
 * ## One option is always chosen, and that is why it is a radio group
 *
 * It used to be a toggle group, and clicking the selected option switched it
 * off: a segmented control showing "1 h · 24 h · 7 d" with none of them lit,
 * and a chart with no range. There is no such state. A set of choices where
 * exactly one is always taken *is* a radio group, so this is built on one --
 * which means the browser refuses to deselect, arrow keys move through the
 * options, and screen readers announce "1 of 6" instead of six unrelated
 * toggle buttons. Nothing had to be written to prevent the empty state; the
 * right primitive does not have it.
 *
 * ## The chip slides
 *
 * The selected background travels from the old option to the new one instead
 * of blinking out and in somewhere else. The travel is what says these are the
 * same six options and only the choice moved; a chip that reappears elsewhere
 * reads as the row itself having changed. It is measured off the DOM rather
 * than computed, because the labels are free text and their widths are not
 * known in advance.
