/**
 * The one closed error union `@rustrak/client` reports.
 *
 * It mirrors `apps/server/src/error.rs` variant by variant, plus the three
 * failures that never reach the server (`invalid_request`, `network`,
 * `invalid_response`) and a catch-all so an unanticipated status is still
 * representable rather than unrepresentable.
 *
 * Every member is a plain object: no class, no prototype chain, no `Error`
 * instance. That is what lets a failed `Result` survive `structuredClone` and
 * therefore React's server/client boundary.
 *
 * `status` is `number`, never a literal union. Pinning literals would make a
 * proxy-generated 502 or a future status a type error at the call site rather
 * than a value the consumer can log.
 *
 * `fields` appears on every member that can carry an `AppError` body, because
 * `AppError::with_field` works on all eight Rust variants: a `Forbidden` or a
 * `NotFound` may name an input just as a `Conflict` does. Only the members
 * that never carry a server body at all (`server_error`, which discards it,
 * plus `invalid_request`, `network` and `invalid_response`, which never had
 * one) omit it. See {@link FieldError}.
